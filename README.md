# RESTfulReqres
A simple example of using Retrofit to connect to a REST API and show the data on an android device

The repository was created as a way for me to implement all the things i've learnt from Lesson 8 of Google's Android Kotlin Fundamentals codelab
(https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-android-fundamentals/overview).

The REST API used in this repository is Reqres (hence the title) and can be found at https://reqres.in/
